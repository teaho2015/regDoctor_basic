##Introduction

A private small project for my mom to register with doctor automatically(register site always too hot and my mom always behaves like a fool in front of computer╮(－_－)╭).
####why put this in public on github?
* Could i blame Nikon? I run out of money for my camera lens...I couldn't afford 7 dollar:stuck_out_tongue:. So this is a temp repo, maybe move to [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) later.
* I need a repo to do Continuous integration.
