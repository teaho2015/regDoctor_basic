## Introduction

[中文](https://github.com/teaho2015/regDoctor_basic/blob/master/README_zh_CN.md)

A private small project for my mom to register with doctor automatically(register site always too busy and my mom always behaves like a fool in front of computer╮(－_－)╭).
This is a temp repo, maybe move to BitBucket later.

I need a repo to do Continuous integration(Jenkins), so i push this little program in github.
